## Requirements
Requirements gathering involves understanding the business goals and stakeholder needs to design effective data systems. This process is organized as a **hierarchy of needs**:

1. **Business Goals and Objectives**: At the top level, these represent what success looks like for the business, such as increasing revenue, market share, or user base.
2. **Stakeholder Needs**: These are the tools, resources, and data systems that individual employees or departments need to meet the high-level business objectives.
3. **System Requirements**: These are the specific needs for data systems that support the stakeholders. They can be broken down into:
    - **Functional Requirements**: What the system does (e.g., detecting fraud in bank transactions).
    - **Non-functional Requirements**: Attributes that ensure proper system functioning, such as latency, scalability, reliability, and security (e.g., handling 10,000 simultaneous users on an e-commerce site).

The main takeaway is that **your role as a data engineer** is tightly connected to business objectives. You need to understand the **stakeholders' needs** and how your work contributes to the **overall goals** of the business. To effectively gather requirements, the recommendation is to engage directly with leadership, such as a **CTO** or **CDO**, to ensure alignment with business strategies.
