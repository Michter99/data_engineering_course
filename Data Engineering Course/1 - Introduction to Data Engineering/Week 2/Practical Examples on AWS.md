## The Data Engineering Lifecycle on AWS
In the **data engineering lifecycle**, AWS provides a comprehensive set of tools for each stage, from source systems and ingestion to storage, transformation, and serving data. Here’s a breakdown of how AWS tools connect to the lifecycle stages:
#### **1. Source Systems:**
- **Amazon RDS**: A relational database service supporting engines like MySQL or PostgreSQL. It simplifies database management tasks such as patching and upgrading.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: A serverless NoSQL database that handles large volumes of data with low latency, making it ideal for real-time applications.
- **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams**: Streams real-time data from user activities or other sources, such as a sales platform.
- **Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)** and **Amazon MSK (Managed Streaming for Kafka)**: Other options for handling message queues and real-time data streams.
#### **2. Ingestion:**
- **AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)**: Automates data migration and replication between databases.
- **AWS Glue ETL Service**: Automates the extraction, transformation, and loading of data, simplifying data integration.
- **Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose**: A streaming data service used to ingest and load real-time data into storage services like S3 or Redshift.
#### **3. Storage:**
- **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Object storage used for building data lakes.
- **Amazon Redshift**: A data warehouse solution that supports structured data.
- **Lakehouse Arrangement**: Combines S3 (data lake) and Redshift (data warehouse) to handle both structured and unstructured data seamlessly.
#### **4. Transformation:**
- **AWS Glue**: A serverless ETL service for transforming data.
- **Apache Spark**: A distributed computing framework for large-scale data processing.
- **dbt (Data Build Tool)**: Helps transform data in data warehouses by organizing and versioning SQL transformations.
#### **5. Serving Data:**
- **Analytics Use Case**:
	- **Amazon Athena**: A serverless query service for structured and unstructured data.
	- **Amazon Redshift**: Supports structured data queries for business intelligence (BI)purposes.
	- **Amazon QuickSight**: AWS’s BI tool for creating dashboards and reports.
	- **Apache Superset** and **Metabase**: Open-source dashboard tools for BI.
- **AI/ML Use Case**:
	- Serving data for model training and working with **vector databases** for product recommenders and large language models.

## The Undercurrents on AWS
In the **data engineering lifecycle**, the undercurrents such as **security**, **data management**, **DataOps**, **orchestration**, **data architecture**, and **software engineering** play critical roles. Here’s how these undercurrents appear and are supported by various tools on AWS:
#### 1. Security:
- **Shared Responsibility Model**: AWS secures the infrastructure (e.g., data centers), while you secure the systems you build on AWS.
- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: Manages roles and permissions, ensuring secure access to AWS resources by users or applications.
- **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: Provides network security, including **security groups** that act as firewalls at the instance level.
#### 2. Data Management:
- **AWS Glue**: Automates metadata management using **Glue crawlers** and **Glue Data Catalog** for discovering, creating, and managing metadata for data stored in S3.
- **Lake Formation**: Centralizes data management for fine-grained access controls and helps manage privacy and discovery.
#### 3. DataOps:
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitors metrics and logs for AWS resources and applications, enabling better observability.
- **CloudWatch Logs**: Stores and analyzes operational logs for better troubleshooting.
- **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)**: Sets up notifications between systems or via email/text when certain events occur.\
- **Open Source Tools**: Tools like **Monte Carlo** and **Bigeye** can be integrated for advanced observability and monitoring.
#### 4. Orchestration:
- **Apache Airflow**: Used to automate workflows. You can run Airflow as an open-source tool or use AWS’s managed version.
- **Emerging Tools**: Newer orchestration frameworks like **Dagster**, **Prefect**, and **Mage** offer alternatives to Airflow.
#### 5. Data Architecture:
- **AWS Well-Architected Framework**: A set of best practices to ensure your architecture is secure, scalable, and efficient. This framework covers operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization.
#### 6. Software Engineering:
- **Amazon Cloud9 IDE**: A web-based IDE running on EC2 for development directly in the cloud.
- **Amazon CodeDeploy**: Helps automate code deployment across different environments.
- **CICD Tools**: Continuous integration and deployment tools like Git and GitHub will be integrated to handle version control and automation.
